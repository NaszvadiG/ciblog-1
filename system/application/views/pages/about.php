                <p>Hi.</p>
                <p>I'm Mengu, aged 22 from Istanbul, Turkey. I'm engaged and soon to get married. I have been working as a web developer since 2005. 
                As many web developers, I have started with PHP and I am still developing PHP applications. And then
                I have started looking for better tools. So I also have Ruby on Rails, Django, Pylons and web2py in my tool box. And of course this blog has been
                developed and designed by me.</p>
                
                <p>I like music. I wish I could say I like both playing and listening but I'm just a listener. I'm a metalhead. I love metal. I love headbanging. 
                I like anger. I like scream. Lacrimas Profundere (before Ave End), Anathema, My Dying Bride, Empyrium, Catamenia, Marduk, Dark Tranquillity, In Flames, 
                Dimmu Borgir, Graveworm are some of my favourite bands. But actually I do not care the genre as long as there's a good melody and lyrics.
                </p>
                
                <p>That's all for now I guess. Later I'll renew this page. :)</p>
